Verhoeff Algorithm

This is an implementation of the Verhoeff algorithm in Swift for checking
that numbers are entered correctly.

According to wikipedia.org, "The Verhoeff algorithm is a checksum
formula for error detection developed by the Dutch mathematician
Jacobus Verhoeff and was first published in 1969. It was the first
decimal check digit algorithm which detects all single-digit errors,
and all transposition errors involving two adjacent digits, which
was at the time thought impossible with such a code."
